## Description

This is a PowerPoint presentation file including my suggestion images for TechNet Guru Inonography.

Current version contains only TechNet Ninja images. But, I will update this presentation if new images are available.

![Ninja VBA](NinjaVBA.png)

This image is created with a Small Basic program Shapes.  And converted to VBA with ToVBA ([XQD349-4](http://smallbasic.com/program/?XQD349-4)).

![TechNet Ninja 2](TechNetNinja2.png)

If you modify the PowerPoint shape, you can convert it to Small Basic code again with GetShapes macro.
