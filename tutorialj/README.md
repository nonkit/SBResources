## Description

This document is a translated version of [Creative Coding with Small Basic](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Tutorial-Creative-Coding-ea3aa30b) into Japanese.

Do you need a learn-to-code tutorial that *everyone* can do, even if they've never written code before?  This is that tutorial! In this tutorial, we cover several basic concepts, such as variables, loops and subroutines and how to apply them to the TextWindow, Turtle and GraphicsWindow objects, with the end result creating a "greeting card" that can be shared with friends and family.

If you're interested in reinforcing math concepts, we've got that covered too, with a little algebra and geometry that you can discuss as it comes up in the program.

This tutorial takes about an hour, including plenty of time for students to work at their own pace to try out the code.

*Required*: Windows computer with Small Basic 1.2 or higher installed
