These audio files are made with CASIO MT-240, Fujitsu Lifebook AH42/M and Windows Sound Recorder installed in Windows 8.1.

Purpose for these audio files is to be used in Small Basic (or other) programming language.  Small Basic program can be published.  So, the files used in that program are better to located on the internet.  This is my challenge to locate audio files in TechNet Gallery and used by Small Basic programs that are published.

I wrote a blog post about how to create these kind of audio files:

[How do you get a sound for your program?](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/small-basic-blog/how-do-you-get-a-sound-for-your-program/ba-p/336882)

A sample Small Basic program to play these audio files is [VTQ526](http://smallbasic.com/program/?VTQ526).
