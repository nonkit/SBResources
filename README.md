# Small Basic Resources
Small Basic Resources (backup from TechNet Gallery)

## Backup and Update Plan
At first, I will backup following documents from [TechNet Gallery](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/) to here.  TechNet Gallery will retire in the first half of 2020.  After that, I will update all links to TechNet Gallery in these documents.
