## Description
This file is a Microsoft PowerPoint Macro-Enabled Presentation.  Following three image files are created from this presentation by [Save as Picture] option.

![Duck.png](Duck.png)

[Duck.png](https://github.com/nonkit/SBResources/raw/master/duck/Duck.png) with transparent background color.

![Duck2.png](Duck2.png)

[Duck2.png](https://github.com/nonkit/SBResources/raw/master/duck/Duck2.png) with opaque background color.

![Sighter.png](Sighter2.png)

[Sighter.png](https://github.com/nonkit/SBResources/raw/master/duck/Sighter.png) with transparent background color.

Original source of these images is DuckShoot 0.1 ([TLR995](http://smallbasic.com/program/?TLR995)).  This program has two subroutines Shapes_Init() and Sighter_Init() that are created with Shapes editor 1.5b ([XFZ657-15](http://smallbasic.com/program/?XFZ657-15)).

And these subroutines are comverted to PowerPoint macros with a tool Converter from Shapes to PowerPoint VBA 0.1 ([XQD349](http://smallbasic.com/program/?XQD349)).
